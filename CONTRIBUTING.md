# Contributing to Fast Track Academy

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Fast Track Academy as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Coding Standards

- Use Python 3.8+ features
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where possible
- Write descriptive docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Add appropriate logging for debugging

### Code Structure

The project follows this structure:

```

â”œâ”€â”€ bot/                    # DutyBot core functionality
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bot_core.py        # Main bot implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ social_media_integration/  # Social media platform integrations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ message_templates/ # Message template system
â”œâ”€â”€ classroom/             # Learning management system
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/         # Course and lesson management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ resources/         # Learning resource management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ achievements/      # Gamification and progress tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ scanned_books/         # Book content and text processing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ book1.txt         # Sample educational content
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ book2.txt         # Sample educational content
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ interpreter.py    # Text processing and search
â””â”€â”€ docs/                 # Documentation (if added)
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Use meaningful test names that describe what is being tested

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Include examples in docstrings where helpful
- Update inline comments for complex logic
